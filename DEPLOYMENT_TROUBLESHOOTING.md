# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you resolve common issues when deploying your PHP Telegram bot.

## Common Docker Build Issues

### 1. "docker-php-ext-install json curl" Error
**Problem**: 
```
cp: cannot stat 'modules/*': No such file or directory
make: *** [Makefile:88: install-modules] Error 1
```

**Solution**: 
- Fixed in our Dockerfile by removing `json` (it's built into PHP)
- Only install `curl` extension:
```dockerfile
RUN docker-php-ext-install curl
```

### 2. "No such file or directory" for modules
**Problem**: Compilation fails during extension installation

**Solution**:
- Ensure you're using the correct PHP base image
- Check that extensions exist for your PHP version
- Use only extensions that are available for PHP 8.1

## Common Render.com Deployment Issues

### 1. Build Failures
**Problem**: Deployment fails during build phase

**Solutions**:
- Check the build logs in Render dashboard
- Verify all required files are in the repository
- Ensure Dockerfile syntax is correct
- Confirm composer.json is valid JSON

### 2. Application Crashes After Deployment
**Problem**: Build succeeds but app crashes when accessed

**Solutions**:
- Check runtime logs in Render dashboard
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure port is set to 8080 in Dockerfile
- Check file permissions in container

### 3. Webhook Not Working
**Problem**: Bot doesn't receive messages from Telegram

**Solutions**:
- Verify webhook URL is set correctly:
  ```
  https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/setWebhook?url=https://your-app.onrender.com
  ```
- Check that your app is accessible from the internet
- Ensure your app responds correctly to webhook requests
- Check that the app is running on the correct port

## Common PHP Runtime Issues

### 1. "Class not found" Errors
**Problem**: PHP cannot find required classes or files

**Solutions**:
- Check that all required files are included with `require_once`
- Verify file paths are correct
- Ensure proper file permissions

### 2. "Function not found" Errors
**Problem**: Required PHP extensions are missing

**Solutions**:
- Install required extensions in Dockerfile:
  ```dockerfile
  RUN docker-php-ext-install curl
  ```
- Check that extensions are listed in composer.json:
  ```json
  "require": {
      "ext-curl": "*"
  }
  ```

### 3. Permission Errors
**Problem**: Cannot write to files or directories

**Solutions**:
- Set proper permissions in Dockerfile:
  ```dockerfile
  RUN chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
  RUN chmod -R 755 /var/www/html
  ```
- Ensure log and data directories exist:
  ```dockerfile
  RUN mkdir -p /var/www/html/logs
  RUN mkdir -p /var/www/html/data
  ```

## Environment Variable Issues

### 1. Variables Not Being Read
**Problem**: Environment variables are not accessible in PHP

**Solutions**:
- Use `getenv()` function in PHP:
  ```php
  $botToken = getenv('TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN');
  ```
- Set variables in Render dashboard:
  ```
  TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_actual_token
  ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID=your_telegram_user_id
  ```

### 2. Fallback Values Not Working
**Problem**: Default values are used instead of environment variables

**Solutions**:
- Check variable names match exactly
- Ensure variables are set before PHP starts
- Use null coalescing operator:
  ```php
  define('BOT_TOKEN', getenv('TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN') ?: 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE');
  ```

## Network and Connectivity Issues

### 1. Cannot Connect to Telegram API
**Problem**: Bot cannot send messages or receive updates

**Solutions**:
- Check that curl extension is installed
- Verify bot token is correct
- Ensure outbound HTTPS connections are allowed
- Check for firewall restrictions

### 2. Webhook URL Not Accessible
**Problem**: Telegram cannot reach your webhook URL

**Solutions**:
- Ensure your app is deployed and running
- Verify the URL is publicly accessible
- Check that HTTPS is used (required by Telegram)
- Confirm port 8080 is exposed and bound

## File System Issues

### 1. Cannot Write to users.json
**Problem**: User data is not being saved

**Solutions**:
- Check file permissions in Dockerfile
- Ensure the directory exists:
  ```php
  if (!file_exists(DATA_DIR)) {
      mkdir(DATA_DIR, 0755, true);
  }
  ```
- Verify the web server user has write permissions

### 2. Log Files Not Created
**Problem**: No logs are being written

**Solutions**:
- Check that log directory exists and has write permissions
- Ensure the log file path is correct
- Verify sufficient disk space

## Testing Your Fixes

### 1. Test Locally with Docker
```bash
docker build -t telegram-bot .
docker run -p 8080:8080 telegram-bot
```

### 2. Test PHP Syntax
```bash
php -l index.php
php -l config.php
```

### 3. Test with Composer
```bash
composer install --dry-run
```
